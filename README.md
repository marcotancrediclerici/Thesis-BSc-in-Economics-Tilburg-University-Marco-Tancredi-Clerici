## Thesis Abstract

The thesis investigates the government ownership effect on the dynamic behavior of publicly
listed Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) compared to private firms in terms of their
systematic risk exposure (beta) across different economic cycles. By estimating rolling betas
using the time-varying Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the study examines whether
Chinese A-shares of SOEs offer hedging opportunities against market volatility, particularly
during recessions and expansions. Using firm-level panel data from 2012 to 2025 and classifying economic cycles phases through the Li Keqiang Index, the analysis concludes that
state ownership does not explain a statistically significant effect on beta over time, while
sector fixed effects explain a larger portion of beta variation across firms. Furthermore,
regressions results show that economic cycles impact beta within sectors, further reinforcing
the importance of sector membership. These findings highlight the limitations of applying
the CAPM model in the still immature Chinese stock market and present the complex role
of SOEs as both stabilizing agents and structurally inefficient companies controlled by the
government. Future research is encouraged to explore improved models with a larger sample
to better capture the small impact of state ownership on market risk.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Thesis-BSc-in-Economics-Tilburg-University-Marco-Tancredi-Clerici.git
   cd Thesis-BSc-in-Economics-Tilburg-University-Marco-Tancredi-Clerici
   ```

2. Set up a Python environment (e.g., using `venv` or `conda`):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. Install required packages (if a `requirements.txt` is provided):

4. Navigate to any of the Python script folders and run the notebooks or scripts as needed.

## Data

The repository includes multiple data directories:

* `Data for analysis/` contains the cleaned and processed datasets used in the core models.
* `Data for graphs/` includes data used to generate visualizations.
* `Data/` holds supporting or raw Excel data files.

## Figures

All graphs used in the thesis are saved in the `Graph figures/` folder in `.png` format. These were generated by the Python notebooks and embedded in the LaTeX thesis.

## Thesis Document

The thesis is written in LaTeX and compiled to PDF. You can find the final PDF here:

* `BSc_Thesis_in_Economics_Marco_Tancredi_Clerici.pdf`
* `BSc_Thesis_in_Economics_Presentation.pdf` (defense slides)
